# TableAssignment

For details on the Assignment, see `ASSIGNMENT.md`.
This project is a docker container that can be used with VSCodes Dev Container features.
The angular project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` to host the application using the dev server.
The port is `:4342`. This container is configured to forward this port to your machine.
The application should be available under `http://localhost:4342/` once the dev server is running.

Note that for Dev Container compatibility, this dev server is configured to listen to host 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces). 
So beware if you're running this outside of a docker container.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

TODO
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
